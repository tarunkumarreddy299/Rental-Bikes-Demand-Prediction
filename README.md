# Rental Bikes Demand Prediction Using Machine Learning
- Demand for rental bikes is predicted using several Machine Learning algorithms.
- Demand for rental bikes depends on the weather conditions on that particular day, so they are chosen as the independent variable.
- Several Machine learning algorithms and techniques were used, including hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.
- This project was part of the Machine Learning course at Sai University.
